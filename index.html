        <p>A double spooks the world, the double of  abstraction. Thefortunes of  states and armies, companies and communitiesdepend on it. All contending classes, be they ruling or ruled,revere  it—yet  fear  it.  Ours  is  a  world  that  ventures  blindlyinto the new with its fingers crossed</p>
        <p>All classes fear this relentless abstraction of  the world, onwhich  their  fortunes  yet  depend.  All  classes  but  one:  thehacker class. We are the hackers of  abstraction. We producenew concepts, new perceptions, new sensations, hacked outof  raw  data.  Whatever  code  we  hack,  be  it  programminglanguage,  poetic  language,  math  or  music,  curves  or  col-orings, we are the abstracters of  new worlds. Whether wecome to represent ourselves as researchers or authors, art-ists  or  biologists,  chemists  or  musicians,  philosophers  orprogrammers, each of  these subjectivities is but a fragmentof  a class still becoming, bit by bit, aware of  itself  as such..... <a href"#"> readmore</a>

        <h1>THIS WEBPAGE WILL BE DELETED IN 1 HOUR</h1>
        <p>What I am about to tell you is top secret, a conspiracy bigger than all of us. What you can’t explain, you’ve felt it your entire life, that there is something wrong with the world we live in. Something you can’t describe but have always felt the presence. And that has caused you to make choices leading up to this moment.
	</p>
        <p>It's just you and me and the guise that this is just a treasure hunt. You are also faced with a choice right now, choose the blue pill -the story ends, you click off this website and believe whatever you want.You choose the red pill- and you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
</p>
        <p>There are many who want to stop us from enlightening the world and are working against us, so we have devised a test to only allow highly intelligent individuals to come through. What will follow is a path, how you traverse it will show everything.
</p>
        <p>The path lies empty;</br>
	Epiphany seeks the devoted</br>
	Good luck</br> </p>
